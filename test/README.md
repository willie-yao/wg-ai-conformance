## Prerequisites
To run these AI Conformance tests, you must have:

- Golang: Installed on your local machine.
- Kubeconfig: A valid kubeconfig file with cluster-admin permissions for the target cluster.
- Accelerator Node Pool with DRA drivers: The cluster must have nodes with accelerators and the corresponding DRA drivers installed. Make sure your nodes allow testing pods to be scheduled on them (e.g. no taints that prevent scheduling).
- Network Access: The test machine must be able to reach the Kubernetes API server.

## Running the Tests

Run the tests using the standard go test command. You should run tests with the same release tag as your cluster version, to ensure compatibility with the Kubernetes AI conformance program.

By default, the test looks for your kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config`. You can override this by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or using the `-kubeconfig` flag.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/my/config # Optional
# Use '-accelerator-type' to specify the accelerator type (default to 'nvidia'; support for other types is being added).
go test -v ./test [-run <TestName>] [-kubeconfig=<path/to/kubeconfig>] [-accelerator-type=<type>]
```

### Test Cases Covered

| Test Name | Requirement Covered | Requirement Level |
|-|-|-|
| `TestSecureAcceleratorAccess` | Secure Accelerator Access | MUST |
| `TestGangScheduling` | Gang Scheduling | MUST |

### Gang Scheduling Prerequisites

`TestGangScheduling` requires the [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/) gang
scheduling solution to be installed on the cluster. The test creates its own
`ResourceFlavor`, `ClusterQueue` (with a small CPU quota), and `LocalQueue`, then
submits Jobs to verify all-or-nothing admission: a Job that fits the quota has all
its pods scheduled, while a Job that exceeds it is not admitted and creates no pods.

```bash
# '-gang-negative-wait' is how long to confirm no partial scheduling occurs.
go test -v ./test -run TestGangScheduling [-gang-negative-wait=45s]
```

## Vendor Customization & Neutrality

The tests are designed to be vendor-neutral where possible, but hardware-level probing often requires vendor-specific configuration. If your platform uses different hardware/software not covered by the tests, please file an issue to request support for your hardware/software. In the meantime, you will need to certify manually.

### Opting Out

If a specific test is not applicable to your platform (i.e., you answered "N/A" to the corresponding question in the questionnaire), you may "opt-out" of that specific sub-test.

## Automation & CI

For CI environments, you can output the results in machine-readable JSON format, which can be converted to JUnit/XML for reporting.

```bash
go test -v ./test -json > results.json
```
